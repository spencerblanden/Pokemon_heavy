# Poke Heavy

In this project a Pokemon API is used to provide data for 3 trivia games- pokemon heavy, pokemon height, and pokemon type. There is a function that allows the user to select which generation of Pokemon they want to be quizzed on. There is a pokemon name page that allows the user to learn the height, type, and weight of any Pokemon.
